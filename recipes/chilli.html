    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Sauté bell pepper, onion, and
        jalapeño peppers in hot oil until tender, about 3 minutes. Add chili
        powder, garlic, salt, and cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about
        10 minutes, making sure chili powder does not burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomatoes, beans, water, and rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat
        to low, cover, and simmer until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes.
        Check after 10 to 15 minutes if extra water is needed; add 1/4 cup at a
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in corn and black pepper, and cook until heated through, about 5
        minutes. Serve with vegan cheese if desired. Enjoy!
